---

## 1) Purpose

Explore the boundary between:
- Feature-based NLP
- Neural modeling

This project answers:
> When does DL add value on top of strong classical features?

---

## 2) Why this structure

- TF-IDF retained for interpretability
- DL applied only at modeling layer
- Baseline comparison is mandatory

---

## 3) Expected artifacts

- Classical baseline model
- Hybrid DL model checkpoint
- Final comparison report
- Evaluation metrics for both approaches

---

## 4) Evaluation focus

- Performance delta vs baseline
- Training stability
- Cost vs benefit tradeoff

---

## 5) Closure checklist

- [ ] Hybrid improves or is justified analytically
- [ ] Baseline comparison is explicit
- [ ] Artifacts reproducible
- [ ] Final report explains conclusions clearly
