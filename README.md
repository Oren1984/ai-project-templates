# AI Project Templates

A personal, evolving repository of **documentation-level templates** for Applied AI projects, aligned with an academic AI engineering syllabus and real-world practice.

---

## What this repository is

This repository is a **personal template hub** that defines how I structure, document, and close Applied AI projects.

The templates are:
- Based on projects that were actually built and executed
- Focused on consistency, reproducibility, and clear deliverables
- Intended for reuse across independent work, coursework, and submissions

This is **not a code framework**, but a collection of **project standards**.

---

## Scope (high-level)

The templates in this repository cover Applied AI work across the following domains:

- **Data Science and Classical Modelling**
- **Deep Learning & NLP**
- **Large Language Models and Generative AI**
- **Engineering LLM-Powered Applications**
- **RAG and Autonomous Agents**

The repository structure may grow over time, but the scope remains aligned with these themes.

## Design principles

All templates in this repository follow the same core principles:

- **Documentation-first** – projects should be understandable without running code
- **Stage-based execution** – clear progression from framing to results
- **Artifacts-first mindset** – models, metrics, figures, and reports are mandatory
- **Reproducibility** – results should be reproducible from a clean environment
- **Separation of concerns** – clear boundaries between data, code, outputs, and docs
- **Clear Definition of Done** – every project has an explicit closure checklist

---

## How to use

1. Navigate to the relevant domain folder.
2. Open the appropriate template file.
3. Copy it into a new project repository (e.g., as `README.md` or under `docs/`).
4. Replace placeholders and adapt details to the specific project.

Each template links to a real reference project for deeper inspection if needed.

---

## What this repository is NOT

- Not a boilerplate generator
- Not a Cookiecutter or scaffolding tool
- Not a tutorial or course material
- Not an official syllabus repository

It reflects a **personal workflow and standards**, not a prescribed methodology.

---

## Growth and evolution

This repository is expected to grow over time as additional independent projects, coursework, and Applied AI experiments are added.

The README is intentionally stable; only the underlying content evolves.
